# LevelUp: AI-Powered Technical Interview Platform

LevelUp streamlines the technical interview process by using generative AI to create unique, topic-specific problems at varying difficulty levels. This addresses the challenge of candidates rehearsing common interview questions, providing a more effective and reliable evaluation of their true problem-solving abilities.

## üöÄ The Problem

The current technical recruitment process is highly predictable. Candidates often memorize solutions to common interview questions, which hinders a hiring manager's ability to assess their actual problem-solving skills. Additionally, creating unique and relevant questions for each candidate is a time-consuming and difficult task for interviewers to scale.

## ‚ú® Our Solution

LevelUp offers a web-based solution that generates complete and unique problem statements with a single click. The platform takes parameters like the desired topic (e.g., "Graph Theory") and difficulty level (e.g., "Medium") to produce a well-structured problem that includes a description, constraints, and sample inputs/outputs.

This is achieved using a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) model that combines keyword and semantic search to retrieve relevant existing problems, which are then used by a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate a new, unique problem.

## Key Features for Hiring

-   **Improve Assessment Quality**: Evaluate candidates on their problem-solving skills, not their memorization abilities.
-   **Save Interviewer Time**: Instantly generate unique problems, significantly reducing preparation time for interviews.
-   **Ensure Fairness**: Provide standardized yet unique challenges for each candidate, ensuring a fair and consistent evaluation process.
-   **Customizable Content**: Tailor problems to specific topics and difficulty levels to match the requirements of the role.

## üèõÔ∏è System Architecture

The LevelUp platform is built on a robust and scalable machine learning system architecture:

1.  **User Interface**: A simple and intuitive web-based interface where users can input their desired problem parameters.
2.  **Backend API Layer**: A FastAPI-based backend that handles user requests and orchestrates the problem generation workflow.
3.  **Data Ingestion**: A scraper ingests problems from sources like Codeforces. This data is then preprocessed and stored.
4.  **Metadata and Vector Storage**: Problem metadata is stored in a PostgreSQL database, while problem embeddings are stored in a Vector Database for efficient semantic retrieval.
5.  **RAG and LLM Pipeline**:
    * An **Embedding Generator** creates vector embeddings of the problems.
    * The **RAG Retriever** finds relevant problems from the vector database based on the user's query.
    * A **Prompt Generator** creates a prompt for the LLM based on the retrieved problems.
    * The **LLM** generates a unique problem based on the provided topic and style.
